<h1>Hey there!</h1>
I'm a computer engineering student learning, exploring, and having a good time.

<h3>Currently Working On</h3>

**NullKart:** a two-wheeled robot that seems super simple on the surface, but will help me answer three questions:
1. How do I really make my code "nice"?<br><br>
My internships made me put a lot of thought into the things I never thought about when writing code for projects: firmware architectures, API design, code reusability, ease of collaboration... so I wanted to do a project *properly* this time. No spaghetti, no gibberish. My goal is to make the code here good enough that my boss would approve the PR.

1. How did my high school robot actually work?<br><br>
I competed in the FIRST Tech Challenge and made some robots do somewhat impressive things. However, I was using FIRST's SDK, as well as a few community-made libraries. My code said, "turn the servo to position 0.7," or "move 40 cm forwards and turn 90 degrees in one motion." With NullKart, every detail will be written by ME. The only abstractions I'm allowing myself are libraries provided by ST such as the STM32 HAL.

1. What do I even want my next project to be?<br><br>
This one kind of explains itself. I hope this project will give me an idea of what areas I want to explore further, because all those sessions of laying in bed and trying to come up with a perfect project idea have been complete wastes of time.
